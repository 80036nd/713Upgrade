What is this?
(Forked form @parrotgeek1)
=============
This is an unofficial iOS 7.1.3 update for the CDMA iPhone 4 (iPhone3,3), which installs the updated baseband used by the CDMA iPad 2's iOS 9.3.6 update. 
This fixes the GPS bug which will cause the CDMA iPhone 4 to stop keeping correct time after November 3, 2019 00:00 UTC.

NOTE: The GSM iPhone 4 and all older devices are not affected by this bug, 

Limitations
===========
Only for Mac!
Does not support Pangu 7 currently

How to install iOS 7.1.3
========================
1) Creating the patched IPSW

Run ./make_ipsw.sh <iOS_7.1.2_IPSW> 

2) Restoring the firmware

Connect your iPhone 4 and put it in DFU mode.
Run ./restore.sh <Patched_IPSW>
Wait for that to complete.
When your phone reboots then it will boot iOS 7.1.3!
